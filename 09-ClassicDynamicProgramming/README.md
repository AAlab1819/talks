# Week 09 - Classic Dynamic Programming
This week, we will cover some classic dynamic programming problems in this class. The title for your weekly submission is `Week09-ClassicDynamicProgramming`.

## Intro
Some classic dynamic programming problem that will be cover are:
- Longest Increasing Subsequence - <i>This problem is finding maximum length k of subsequence which its elements are increasing in order <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a_1%3Ca_2%3C...%3Ca_k">.</i>
- Coin Change - <i>This problem is finding how many ways to give changes with some particular coins.</i>
- Knapsack - <i>Knapsack problem is finding the best value we can get in a condition where each item has weight and worth. Knapsack problems divided into two types, Knapsack with repetitive and Knapsack without repetitive (0-1 Knapsack). Knapsack with repetitive is knapsack where there is infinite number of specific items. 0-1 Knapsack is knapsack where there is only one number of specific items / finite.</i>

## Activity
### Whiteboard session and weekly submissions
This time the problem for whiteboard session and weekly submissions are the same. This week we do not score the verdict because this week's problem do not taken from Codeforces. We do score your explanation and implementation. So please implement and explain how to solve it.
