# Analysis Algorithm Lab Class, Odd Term 2018/2019

Hi! This is Captain Livia speaking, along with our co-captain Kim, and welcome to the lab! You are not expected to wear your lab coats and safety gloves (although you're allowed to do so), but have fun and follow the rules stated below. Remember, 30% of your AA grade depends on this class.

## Prerequisite
- Had enrolled in these classes: `Programming and Algorithm` and `Data Structure`
- Have a GitHub account
- Have a Codeforces account
- Able to write in [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Rules

> "Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist." -- **Pablo Picasso**

Do you know that companies need your degree not because they need your skill, but your mindset? College lessons shape your mindset so that everyone in the field could align their mindsets easily. These rules, hopefully, will not only be mere rules; you can make them a good habit as a software engineer.

0. Every content we provide might change. Take notice. Watch this repository if you need notification every time we made any changes.

1. **Solve problems**  
Software engineers are problem solvers. Hence why we give you competitive-programming-styled questions, because they force you to see them as problems you have to solve. Break them down to subproblems and tackle them one-by-one. Don't run!

2. **Improve constantly**  
So there's this way better solution, other than bruteforce, that you can apply to a problem. DO IT! Ever heard about _technical debts_? You can choose an easy solution rather than the better approach that would take longer to work on but runs more efficiently in the future, but someday you might have to rework that easy solution and it cause additional cost. Avoid any tech debts.

3. **Speak up and act on it**  
Your daily GO-FOOD won't be available if Nadiem Makarim never took any step to make his dreams come true. Ideas will remain as mere ideas if you never speak up and act on it. Hence why we have whiteboard session where you are forced to tell us how do you think a problem could be solved. Never afraid to talk to others about your ideas. Also, show a proof on why you believe your ideas are worth to consider.

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." -- **Phil Karlton**

4. **Be clear and concise**  
Since your grade depends on your code submission, make sure that you write clean codes with self-explanatory names. Okay, the problem might state `n` as their input so you use `n` for inputs, but don't name your variable that holds sum with `s`; how would we know that `s` is sum and not string? Your GitHub account will become your _portfolio_ when you apply for jobs and interns, so make your codes as great and understandable as possible.

5. **Do all tasks in time**  
In this class, the only way to learn properly is by doing. Finishing all tasks will not only give you extra credits, but also deepen your understanding. Moreover, by submitting them in time, you'll train yourself to avoid delays that consume more cost.

6. **English, please**  
Here in GitHub, everyone can see your code and they might use it for their needs. Use English for internationalization and contribute to the open source world, no matter how broken your skills are.

In case you notice, we didn't mention any rules that prohibited copying source code. Does that mean I can copy any code from Stack Overflow or from my friend's? Yes, but. But. If the source said you cannot reuse the code, respect them and do not reuse it.

You can play within the rules, but play smart.

## Tasks
20% of your overall AA grade will depend on two activities:
- Weekly submission
- Whiteboard session

### Weekly submissions

In weekly submissions, we will give you some CP-styled problems from Codeforces. You can solve these problems in _C, C++, Java,_ or _Python_. Don't forget to submit them to Codeforces with your own account; if your submission was not `Accepted`, we would still count it as a part of your weekly submission.

Create a folder in your repository with format `Week##-Topic`. For example, if you learn sorting on the second week, your folder will be named `Week02-Sorting`. That folder will contain all your source code for week ##'s submission, along with a `README.md`. In this file, you will link all your Codeforces submission [(example)](http://codeforces.com/contest/4/submission/16729903) and explain your thought process; why do you solve it that way? Also, if we finally reached `Week03-Complexity`, do not forget to calculate the complexity of your solution and include them in your explanation.

As for us, we will randomly choose one problem to be graded. For example, if the random number generator make us grade problem 4A but you didn't do it, we would consider you not submitting anything that week and you'll get 0.

We will grade your weekly submission based on:
- **Lateness**; late submission will result in 50% score cut.
- **Verdict**; an `Accepted` verdict results in 40 points, while other verdicts like `Wrong Answer` and `Time Limit Exceeded` results in 20 points.
- **Explanation**; a well-describe thought process and correct complexity calculation results in 50 points.
- **Clean code**; a well-written code results in 10 points.

In total, you can get up to **100** points a week.

### Whiteboard session
Our classroom is a little bit inadequate for this activity, but we'll try to make do :grin:

In whiteboard session, you will be faced with a Codeforces problem related to this week's topic. Instead of writing the code like the weekly session did, you will have to describe and draw your thought process on a whiteboard in front of the whole class! Remember our third rule? Speak up and act on it. Especially in whiteboard session.

This time, your score will be based on your thought process only. Each student has one chance to do a whiteboard session in this term, and one session equals to one weekly submission.

### Extra points

Can I have extra points, please? :dog: Yes, by applying the second and third rule at whiteboard session!

If you think you have a better solution, speak up to us and we will give you a chance to publicly explain your idea in front of the class. But if your idea includes something that hasn't been (but will be) taught in the class, we will ask you to explain privately to us. For example, if you propose using hash map while the class hasn't explained maps yet, you shouldn't explain your idea publicly, but you'll still get extra points for being a step ahead.
