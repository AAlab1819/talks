# Week 02 - Sorting

Thank you for coming to this class! The title for your weekly submission is `Week02-Sorting`.

## Rules for Submission

In this week, we are going to learn about types of sortings. Because of that, we will have a special rule for this week's submission: **you have to write your own sorting code**, no STL allowed! And also, each questions should be written in different sorting method.

These are sorting algorithms already used in VisuAlgo:
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort

Scoring system, for verdicts, will go like this:
- Time Limit Exceeded or Memory Limit Exceeded, using sorting algorithm explained in VisuAlgo = 40 points
- Accepted, using sorting algorithm explained in VisuAlgo = 45 points (yes, we
re giving out bonuses)
- Time Limit Exceeded or Memory Limit Exceeded, using sorting algorithm not explained in VisuAlgo = 50 points
- Accepted, using sorting algorithm not explained in VisuAlgo = 60 points
