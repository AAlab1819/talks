# Week 03 - Complexity

Thank you for coming to this class! The title for your weekly submission is `Week03-Complexity`. Hopefully you've read the reading materials before coming into this class.

## Rules for Submission
In this week, we are going to learn about complexity. Remember, from now on, you should include the worst-case time analysis in your thought process. If you want to improve someone else's whiteboard session, make sure your time complexity could become more efficient.

Special for this week, anyone who can calculate best case and average case analysis will be granted extra points.
- Include only best/average case analysis in one problem: _+5 points_ for each problem
- Include best & average case analysis in one problem: _+12 points_ for each problem
- Include only best/average case analysis in three problems: _+18 points_
- Include best & average case analysis in three problems: _+40 points_

**Note:** If you used STL `sort`, usually their worst-case is O(n log(n)).
