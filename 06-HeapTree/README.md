# Week 06 - Heap Tree
This week, we will cover Heap Tree in this class. The title for your weekly submission is `Week06-HeapTree`.

## Intro
Heap tree (binary heap) is binary tree data structure with two properties.
1. Shape property - a complete binary tree
2. Order/Heap property - root of each subtree value must be `greater than or equal to` (max-heap) or `less than or equal to` (min-heap) each of its children

Operations:
1. Insert a value
2. Get root value
2. Delete root
3. Build a binary heap

### Weekly submissions
This week we do not score the verdict because this week's problem do not taken from Codeforces. We do score your explanation and implementation. So please implement the heap yourself.
